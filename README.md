# Bingo

### What is the purpose of your project?
The purpose of the project is to create an app that calls off balls in a bingo hall and allows players to have a good time. It highlights the balls that have been called, and cycles to a next one when the previous one was called. 

### Who is the app designed for?
The app is designed for a bingo club run at Maryville. He wants the app to be easy to use, and to be shown all around the room for multiple bingo players.

The app will be AirPlayed on Apple TVs around the room rather than on paper off of a projector.
